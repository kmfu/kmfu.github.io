2 Powering the instrument
There are three primary ways of powering the instrument. In each of these cases, the power cable that is stored in the instrument case is attached to the power source on one end, and to the instrument on the other end.

“Brick” battery: The rechargeable NiCad battery is stored in the instrument case, and can provide power for several hours. The NiCad battery has a capacity of 18 Ah, and will run the instrument continuously for about 3 or 4 hours. When using the charger for this battery, be sure to follow the instructions printed on the charger (i.e., plug in to the wall and wait until the light turns yellow before connecting the battery).
Deep-cycle battery + crocodile clips: The instrument comes with crocodile clips/clamps that can be connected to any 12-24V battery to power the instrument. If a 100 Ah deep-cycle battery is used, this should be sufficient to power the instrument all day.
Bench-top power supply: The instrument also comes with a banana clip cable that can be plugged into a bench-top power supply. The instrument pulls up to 3A of current, so set the power supply current limiter at 5A, and set the voltage at 14V.
Mounting and leveling

The instrument mounts to any standard surveying tripod with a 1/2 inch threaded fitting.
It is not explicitly necessary to level the instrument after setting the tripod. It has an internal sensor that records the tilt and roll angle, which can be used to account for un-level conditions. However, changing the leveling of the instrument will effectively change the scanning pattern of surrounding objects, so it may be desirable to get the scanner approximately level. This can be done by eye, or using the on-board sensor. From the main screen, go to Settings->Scanner Position Setup. This indicates the number of degrees off of level. It is important to note that the scale range is automatically adjusted, so you must pay attention to the values listed on the scale as you are
leveling.
4 Turning the instrument on and off
The Power On/Off button is located on the lower base of the instrument near where the power cable plugs in. To turn on, simply press the power button for 2 seconds. Importantly, to turn off the instrument, press and hold the power button for 2 seconds only, which will initiate the shutdown procedure (you will see the message “Shutdown Please Wait..”). If you hold the power button for longer (about 5 seconds), this will trigger a hard shutdown and will give you an error message the next time the instrument is powered on (in addition to possibly not saving some settings).

The current project is indicated on the main screen of the instrument near the top. The projects are simply a means of grouping scans. To create a new project, navigate to the project bar on the main
