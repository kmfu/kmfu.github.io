Brief Intro:
------
  * "Inceptio & Tsinghua AIR Cup" is the first competition in China that covers both trunk logistics and urban road. The first competition focuses on decision planning algorithms, inviting global autonomous driving enthusiasts to solve real-world technical problems and challenge the limits of algorithms under the constraints of mass production.
  * The competition provides scenarios and data for high-speed heavy trucks and complex urban roads, while the data for the competition questions are all derived from real scenarios.
