Kaiming (Kimi) Fu is a doctoral student in the Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of California, Davis. He is working with guidance from Prof. [Stavros G. Vougioukas](https://faculty.engineering.ucdavis.edu/vougioukas/research/lab-members/) and Prof. [Brian N. Bailey](https://baileylab.ucdavis.edu/people/index.html). Before that, He received M.S degree in Mechanical Engineering from Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana (2019). His research is interdisciplinary, incorporating his expertise in engineering and computer science to focus on agricultural robotics and computer vision. His research interest includes:
* Simulation Design and Optimization of Agricultural Robotics.
* Crop Counting Through Deep Learning Enhanced By Synthetic Images.


Ongoing Research Projects
======
1. Register a GitHub account if you don't have one and confirm your e-mail (required!)
1. Fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) by clicking the "fork" button in the top right. 
1. Go to the repository's settings (rightmost item in the tabs that start with "Code", should be below "Unwatch"). Rename the repository "[your GitHub username].github.io", which will also be your website's URL.
1. Set site-wide configuration and create content & metadata (see below -- also see [this set of diffs](http://archive.is/3TPas) showing what files were changed to set up [an example site](https://getorg-testacct.github.io) for a user with the username "getorg-testacct")
1. Upload any files (like PDFs, .zip files, etc.) to the files/ directory. They will appear at https://[your GitHub username].github.io/files/example.pdf.  
1. Check status by going to the repository settings, in the "GitHub pages" section


Challenges
======

Annual Farm Robotics Challenge
------

The challenge is being sponsored by [The VINE](https://ucanr.edu/News/?blogtag=The%20VINE), an initiative of the University of California Agriculture and Natural Resources focused on agricultural innovation, in partnership with the [AI Institute for Next Generation Food Systems (AIFS)](https://www.aifs.ucdavis.edu), [Farm-ng robotics company](https://farm-ng.com/pages/about-farm-ng), and the [Fresno-Merced Future of Food (F3) Innovation coalition](https://www.eda.gov/funding/programs/american-rescue-plan/build-back-better/finalists/central-valley-community-foundation). The Farm Robotics Challenge is open to any university or college in the U.S. Student teams will be asked to address a production farming topic on any crop or size of farm, with a desired focus on small farms, by automating an essential farm-related task using the farm-ng robotics platform. Each campus will need to purchase a farm-ng robot or borrow one to participate in the challenge.
