Kaiming (Kimi) Fu is a doctoral student in the Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of California, Davis. He is working with guidance from Prof. [Stavros G. Vougioukas](https://faculty.engineering.ucdavis.edu/vougioukas/research/lab-members/) and Prof. [Brian N. Bailey](https://baileylab.ucdavis.edu/people/index.html). Before that, He received M.S degree in Mechanical Engineering from Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana (2019). His research is interdisciplinary, incorporating his expertise in engineering and computer science to focus on agricultural robotics and computer vision. His research interest includes:
* Simulation Design and Optimization for Robotics, along with Conducting Interference Analysis using CUDA and Voxel Technology.
* Enhancing Object Detection in Complex Lighting with Multispectral Synthetic Data and Deep Learning.
* Exploring Diverse Applications of [Helios](https://baileylab.ucdavis.edu/software/helios/index.html) (A Versatile Modeling Framework).

Ongoing Research Projects
======
* Model-based Design of Mechanized Orchard-harvesting Systems
  * We are currently building model-based design tools to enable researchers and developers to investigate the interrelationships among orchard layout, tree canopy geometry and spatial fruit distribution, harvester design, and worker activities. Such tools can accelerate the development of next-generation orchard mechanization and automation systems.
* Walnut Detection Through Deep Learning Enhanced by Multispectral Synthetic Images
  * We are using YOLOv8 to detect walnuts, trained on a enriched dataset that includes both real and synthetic RGB and NIR images. The challenge lies in accurately distinguishing between walnuts and leaves due to their similar shapes, colors, and textures.

Challenges
======
Annual Farm Robotics Challenge
------
* Team Leader. Collabrating with Dr. [Juan Villacrés](https://www.linkedin.com/in/juan-villacrés-054b71169/) and Dr. [Guilherme De Moura Araujo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/guilhermedemouraa/) on Supervising.
* [Grand Prize Winner](https://ucanr.edu/News/?routeName=newsstory&postnum=57108) among National-wide Universities and Colleges.
* Brief Intro:
  * The Farm Robotics Challenge is open to any university or college in the U.S. Student teams will be asked to address a production farming topic on any crop or size of farm, with a desired focus on small farms, by automating an essential farm-related task using the farm-ng robotics platform. Each campus will need to purchase a farm-ng robot or borrow one to participate in the challenge.
  * The challenge is being sponsored by [The VINE](https://ucanr.edu/News/?blogtag=The%20VINE), an initiative of the University of California Agriculture and Natural Resources focused on agricultural innovation, in partnership with the [AI Institute for Next Generation Food Systems (AIFS)](https://www.aifs.ucdavis.edu), [Farm-ng robotics company](https://farm-ng.com/pages/about-farm-ng), and the [Fresno-Merced Future of Food (F3) Innovation coalition](https://www.eda.gov/funding/programs/american-rescue-plan/build-back-better/finalists/central-valley-community-foundation). 

"Inceptio-Tsinghua AIR Cup” Autonomous Driving Challenge
------
* [1st Prize Winner](https://min.news/en/tech/d0f74264edf0ba9c211e13b5dcb468f8.html) among 1067 teams.
* Brief Intro:
  * "Inceptio & Tsinghua AIR Cup" is the first competition in China that covers both trunk logistics and urban road. The first competition focuses on decision planning algorithms, inviting global autonomous driving enthusiasts to solve real-world technical problems and challenge the limits of algorithms under the constraints of mass production.
  * The competition provides scenarios and data for high-speed heavy trucks and complex urban roads, while the data for the competition questions are all derived from real scenarios.
